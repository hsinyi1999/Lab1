Consider the following algorithm:
1. input n
2. print n
3. if n = 1 then STOP
4. if n is odd then n ← 3n + 1
5. else n ← n/2
6. GOTO 2
Given the input 22, the following sequence of numbers will be printed:
22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
Write a C++ program to read in an integer and print out the corresponding
sequence of numbers. You do not need to worry about the overflow problem.
